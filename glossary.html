<div class="clTopicText">
<p>Cards and faction sheets each have abilities that players can resolve to trigger various game effects.</p>
<p>1.1 Each ability describes when and how a player can resolve it.</p>
<p>1.2 If a card has multiple abilities, each ability is presented as its own paragraph.</p>
<p>1.3 If an ability begins with a bolded "Action", a player must use a component action during the action phase to resolve that ability.</p>
<p>1.4 If an ability uses the word "cannot", that effect is absolute.</p>
<p>1.5 When a player resolves an ability, he must resolve the ability in its entirety. Any parts of the ability preceded by the word "may" are optional, and the player resolving the ability may choose not to resolve those parts.</p>
<p>1.6 Abilities on components that remain in play are mandatory unless they use the word "may."</p>
<p>1.7 If an ability has multiple effects separated by the word "and", a player must resolve as many of the ability's effects as possible. However, if he cannot resolve all of its effects, he is allowed to resolve as many as he can.</p>
<p>1.8 COSTS</p>
<p>1.9 Some abilities have a cost that is followed by an effect. The cost of an ability is separated from the effect by the word "to" or by a semicolon. A player cannot resolve the effect of such an ability if he cannot resolve that ability's cost.</p>
<p>1.10 Some examples of an ability's cost include spending resources, spending trade goods, spending command tokens, exhausting cards, and activating specific systems.</p>
<p>1.11 TIMING</p>
<p>1.12 If the timing of an ability uses the word "before" or "after", the ability's effect occurs immediately before or after the described timing event, respectively.</p>
<ul>
    <li>For example, if an ability is resolved "after a ship is destroyed", the ability must be resolved as soon as the ship is destroyed and not later during that turn or round.</li>
    <li>After the last round of a combat, abilities that occur "after a round of combat" and "after combat ends" occur during the same timing window. Likewise, at the start of the firstround of combat, abilities that occur "at the start of combat" and "at the start of a round of combat" occur during the same timing window. The order of resolution for these abilities follows the rules established in the timing section.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.13 If the timing of an ability uses the word "when", the ability's effect occurs at the moment of the described timing event.</p>
<ul><li>Such an ability typically modifies or replaces the timing event in some way.</li></ul>
<p>1.14 Effects that occur "when" an event happens take priority over effects that occur "after" an event happens.</p>
<p>1.15 If an ability uses the word "then", a player must resolve the effect that occurs before the word "then" before resolving the effect that occurs after the word "then."</p>
<p>1.16 Each ability can be resolved once for each occurrence of that ability's timing event. For example, if an ability is resolved "At the start of combat", it can be resolved at the start of each combat.</p>
<p>1.17 COMPONENT-SPECIFIC RULES</p>
<p>1.18 The opening paragraph of each ability found on an action card describes when a player can resolve that card's ability.</p>
<p>1.19 The opening paragraph of most abilities found on promissory notes describes when a player can resolve that card's ability.</p>
<ul><li>Some promissory notes have abilities that trigger as soon as a player receives the card.</li></ul>
<p>1.20 Abilities on agenda cards correspond to an outcome. Players resolve these abilities during the agenda phase after players vote for a particular outcome.</p>
<p>1.21 Each faction has faction abilities presented on its faction sheet. Each faction's flagship has one or more unique abilities. Some abilities provide players with perpetual effects.</p>
<p>1.22 Some units have unit abilities. These abilities are named and presented above a unit's attributes on a player's faction sheet or on a unit upgrade card. Each unit ability has unique rules for when a player can resolve that ability. The following abilities are unit abilities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Anti-Fighter Barrage</li>
    <li>Bombardment</li>
    <li>Planetary Shield</li>
    <li>Production</li>
    <li>Space Cannon</li>
    <li>Sustain Damage</li>
</ul>
<p>1.23 If a unit's ability uses the phrase "this system" or "this planet", the ability is referring to the system or planet that contains that unit.</p>

<div class="clTopicText">
<p>Action cards provide players with various abilities that they can resolve as described on the cards.</p>
<p>2.1 Each player draws one action card during each status phase.</p>
<p>2.2 Players can draw action cards by resolving the primary and secondary abilities of the "Politics" strategy card.</p>
<p>2.3 When a player draws an action card, he takes the top card from the action card deck and adds it to his hand of action cards.</p>
<p>2.4 Each player can have a maximum of seven action cards in his hand at any time. If a player ever has more than seven action cards, he must choose which seven cards he wishes to keep and discard the rest.</p>
<ul><li>A game effect can increase or decrease the number of cards a player can have in his hand.</li></ul>
<p>2.5 A player's action cards remain hidden from other players until they are played.</p>
<p>2.6 The first paragraph of each action card is presented in bold text and describes the timing of when that card's ability can be resolved.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If an action card contains the word "Action", a player must use a component action during the action phase to resolve the ability. A player cannot resolve a component action if he cannot completely resolve its ability.</li>
    <li>Multiple action cards with the same name cannot be played during a single timing window to affect the same units or game effect. Canceled cards do not count as being played.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.7 To play an action card, a player reads and resolves the card's ability text, making any decisions as prompted by the card. Then, he discards the card, placing it in the action discard pile.</p>
<p>2.8 If an action card is canceled, that card has no effect and is discarded.</p>
<p>2.9 During the action phase, if two or more action cards or other abilities would be resolved during the same timing window, players should use the timing rules on page 4 to determine the correct order of resolution.</p>
<p>2.10 During the strategy and agenda phases, if two or more action cards or other abilities would be resolved during the same timing window, players should use the timing rules on page 4 to determine the correct order of resolution</p>

<p>Agenda cards represent galactic laws and policies. During each agenda phase, players cast votes for specific outcomes on two agenda cards.</p>
<p>7.1 There are two types of agenda cards: laws and directives.</p>
<p>7. 2 Laws can permanently change the rules of the game.7. 3 When resolving a law, if a "For" outcome received the most votes, or if the law requires an election, the law's ability becomes a permanent part of the game. Players resolve the outcome and place the agenda card either in the common play area or in a player's play area, as dictated by the card.</p>
<p>7.4 If a law is in a player's play area as opposed to the common play area, that player owns that law.</p>
<p>7. 5 If a law is discarded from play, that law's ability is no longer in effect. Place that card on the top of the agenda card discard pile.</p>
<p>7.6 If an "Against" outcome of a law received the most votes, players resolve the outcome and discard the agenda.</p>
<p>7.7 Directives provide one-time game effects.</p>
<p>7.8 When resolving a directive, players resolve the outcome that received the most votes and discard the agenda card.</p>

<div class="clTopic"><div class="clTopicName">8 AGENDA PHASE<span class="_fr"> Phase de Projet</span></div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>During the agenda phase, players can cast votes on agendas that can change the rules of the game.</p>
<p>8.1 Players skip the agenda phase during the early portion of each game. After the custodians token is removed from Mecatol Rex, the agenda phase is added to each game round. To resolve the agenda phase, players perform the following steps:</p>
<p>8.2 STEP 1-FIRST AGENDA: Players resolve the first agenda by following these steps in order:</p>
<p>i. REVEAL AGENDA: The speaker draws one agenda card from the top of the agenda deck and reads it aloud to all players, including all of its possible outcomes.</p>
<p>ii. VOTE: Each player, starting with the player to the left of the speaker and continuing clockwise, can cast votes for an outcome of the current agenda.</p>
<p>iii. RESOLVE OUTCOME: Players tally each vote that was cast and resolve the outcome that received the most votes.</p>
<p>8.3 STEP 2-SECOND AGENDA: Players repeat the "First Agenda" step of this phase for a second agenda.</p>
<p>8.4 STEP 3-READY PLANETS: Each player readies each of his exhausted planets. Then, a new game round begins starting with the strategy phase.</p>
<p>8.5 VOTING</p>
<p>When voting during the agenda phase, a player can cast votes for a specific outcome of an agenda.</p>
<p>8.6 To cast votes, a player exhausts any number of his planets. The player casts a number of votes for an outcome of his choice equal to the combined influence values of the planets he exhausted.</p>
<ul><li>When a player exhausts a planet to cast votes, he must cast the full amount of votes provided by that planet.</li></ul>
<p>8.7 A player cannot cast votes for multiple outcomes of the same agenda. Each vote he casts must be for the same outcome.</p>
<p>8.8 Some agendas have "For" and "Against" outcomes. When a player casts votes on such an agenda, he must cast his votes either "For" or "Against."</p>
<p>8.9 Some agendas instruct players to elect either a player or a planet. When a player casts votes for such an agenda, he must cast his vote for an eligible player or planet as described on the agenda.</p>
<p>8.10 When electing a player, a player can cast votes for himself.</p>
<ul><li>When resolving these agendas, the "elected player" is the player who had the most votes cast for him.</li></ul>
<p>8.11 When electing a planet, a player must cast votes for a planet that is controlled by a player.</p>
<ul><li>When resolving these agendas, the "elected planet" is the planet that had the most votes cast for it.</li></ul>
<p>8.12 When casting votes, a player must declare aloud the outcome for which his votes are being cast.</p>
<p>8.13 Trade goods cannot be spent to cast votes.</p>
<p>8.14 A player may choose to abstain by not casting any votes.</p>
<p>8.15 Some game effects allow a player to cast additional votes for an outcome. These votes cannot be cast for a different outcome than other votes cast by that player.</p>
<p>8.16 If a player cannot vote on an agenda because of a game effect, he cannot cast votes for that agenda by exhausting planets or through any other game effect.</p>
<p>8.17 OUTCOMES</p>
<p>8.18 To resolve an outcome, the speaker follows the instructions on the agenda card.</p>
<p>8.19 If there is a tie for the outcome that received the most votes, the speaker decides which of the tied outcomes to resolve.</p>
<p>8.20 If an "Elect" or "For" outcome of a law was resolved, that card remains in play and permanently affects the game.</p>
<p>8.21 If a directive or an "against" outcome of a law was resolved, that card is placed in the agenda discard pile.</p>
<p>8.22 Some game effects instruct a player to predict an outcome. To predict an outcome, a player declares aloud the outcome he thinks will receive the most votes. He must make this prediction after the agenda is revealed but before any votes have been cast.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A predicted outcome must be a possible outcome of the revealed agenda.</li>
    <li>After resolving the outcome of the agenda, resolve any abilities that were dependent upon predicting the outcome.</li>

<p>During the "Invasion" step of a tactical action, if the active player commits ground forces to land on a planet that contains another player's ground forces, those players resolve a ground combat on that planet. To resolve a ground combat, players perform the following steps:</p>
<p>38.1 STEP 1-ROLL DICE: Each player rolls one die for each ground force he has on the planet; this is a combat roll. If a unit's combat roll produces a result that is equal to or greater than that unit's combat value, that roll produces a hit.</p>
<ul><li>If a unit's combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls one die for each burst icon instead.14</li></ul>

<ul><li>When a unit is destroyed, the player who controls that unit removes it from the board and places it in his reinforcements.</li></ul>

<div class="clTopicText">
<p>The primary way in which a player produces new units is by resolving the "Production" abilities of his units during a tactical action. However, other game effects also allow players to produce units.</p>
<p>58.1 Each unit that a player can produce has a cost value presented on its faction sheet or technology card. To produce a unit, a player must spend a number of resources from planets he controls equal to or greater than the cost value of the unit he is producing.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any resources spent in excess of a unit's cost are lost.</li>
    <li>If a player is producing multiple units at a time, he can add the cost of all the units he is producing to create a total cost before he spends any resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>58.2 If the cost is accompanied by two icons-typically forfighters and ground forces-a player produces two of that it for that cost.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each of the two units counts toward the total number of units a player can produce.</li>
    <li>A player can choose to produce only one unit; however, he must still pay the entire cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>58.3 When a player produces a unit through the use of his units' "Production" abilities during a tactical action, he follows the rules of the "Production" ability to determine where he can place his units in the active system.</p>
<p>58.4 When a player produces a unit through an ability outside of the tactical action, that ability will state where the player can place the units he is producing and how many units he can produce.</p>
<p>58.5 A player is limited by the number of units in his reinforcements.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If he does not have enough units in his reinforcements, he can remove units from any systems that do not contain one of his command tokens and place them in his reinforcements. Then, he can produce any units that he removed. He cannot remove a unit in this way unless he is immediately producing a unit of that type.</li>
    <li>When producing a fighter or infantry unit, he can use a fighter or infantry token, as appropriate, from the supply instead of a plastic piece.</li>

<div class="clTopicText">
<p>A unit that has the "Space Cannon" ability can use it during two different steps of a player's tactical action: after the "Move Ships" substep (Space Cannon Offense) and during an invasion (Space Cannon Defense).</p>
<p>66.1 A player is not required to be the active player to use the "Space Cannon" abilities of his units.</p>
<p>66.2 SPACE CANNON OFFENSE</p>
<p>During a tactical action, after the "Move Ships" substep of the "Movement" step, players can resolve the "Space Cannon" abilities of their units by performing the following steps:</p>
<p>66.3 STEP 1 - Beginning with the active player and proceeding clockwise, each player may use the "Space Cannon" ability of each of his units in the active system by rolling a specific number of dice for each of those units; these are called space cannon rolls. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit's "Space Cannon" value.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a unit has a "Space Cannon" ability, it is present on its faction sheet and technology cards.</li>
    <li>"Space Cannon" is displayed as "Space Cannon X (Y)." The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all "Space Cannon" abilities are accompanied by a (Y) value; a space cannon roll for such a unit consists of one die.</li>
    <li>If a player has the "Deep Space Cannon" technology, he can use the "Space Cannon" ability of his PDS units that are in systems that are adjacent to the active system. The hits are still assigned to units in the active system.</li>
    <li>Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect space cannon rolls.</li>
</ul>
<p>66.4 This ability can be used even if no ships were moved during the "Move Ships" step.</p>
<p>66.5 STEP 2 - The active player must choose and destroy one of his ships in the active system for each hit result produced against his units.</p>
<ul><li>If the active player is using the "Space Cannon" ability of his units, he chooses a player who has ships in the active system. That player must choose and destroy one of his ships in the active system for each hit the space cannon roll produced.</li></ul>
<p>66.6 SPACE CANNON DEFENSE</p>
<p>During the invasion step of a tactical action, after ground forces have been committed to land on planets, players other than the active player can resolve the "Space Cannon" abilities of their units on those planets by performing the following these steps:</p>
<p>66.7 STEP 1-Each player may use the "Space Cannon" ability of each of his units on the invaded planet by rolling a specific number of dice for each of those units; this is called a space cannon roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit's "Space Cannon" value.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a unit has a "Space Cannon" ability, it is present on its faction sheet and technology cards.</li>
    <li>"Space Cannon" is displayed as "Space Cannon X (Y)." The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all "Space Cannon" abilities are accompanied by a (Y) value; a space cannon roll for such a unit consists of one die.</li>
    <li>Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect space cannon rolls.</li>
    <li>Game effects that allow the use of "Space Cannon" abilities against ships in adjacent systems have no effect during Space Cannon Defense.</li>

<div class="clTopic"><div class="clTopicName">67 SPACE COMBAT<span class="_fr"> Combat spatial</span></div>
<div class="clTopicText">
<p>After resolving the "Space Cannon Offense" step of a tactical action, if two players have ships in the active system, those players must resolve a space combat.</p>
<p>67.1 If the active player is the only player with ships in the system, he skips the "Space Combat" step of the tactical action and proceeds to the "Invasion" step.</p>
<p>67. 2 If an ability occurs "before combat", it occurs immediately before the "Anti-Fighter Barrage" step.</p>
<p>To resolve a space combat, players perform the following steps:</p>
<p>67. 3 STEP 1-ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE: If this is the first round of a space combat, the players may simultaneously use the "Anti-Fighter Barrage" ability of any of their units in the active system.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If one or both players no longer have ships in the active system after resolving this step, the space combat ends immediately.</li>
    <li>Players cannot resolve "Anti-Fighter Barrage" abilities during any rounds of space combat other than the first round.</li>
</ul>
<p>67.4 STEP 2-ANNOUNCE RETREATS: Each player may announce a retreat, beginning with the defender.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A retreat will not occur immediately; the units will retreat during the "Retreat" step.</li>
    <li>If the defender announces a retreat, the attacker cannot announce a retreat during that combat round.</li>
    <li>If a player wishes to retreat with any of his ground forces that are on planets he controls in the active system, he may place those units in the space area of the active system during this step.</li>
</ul>
<p>67. 5 STEP 3-ROLL DICE: Each player rolls one die for each ship he has in the active system; this is called a combat roll. If a unit's combat roll produces a result that is equal to or greater than that unit's combat value, that result produces a hit.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a unit's combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls one die for each burst icon instead.</li>
    <li>If a player has ships that have different combat values in the active system, he rolls these dice separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>- First, he should roll all dice for his units with a combat value of "1." Then, he should roll all dice for his units with combat value of "2", and then "3", continuing in numerical order until he has rolled dice for each of his ships.</p>
<p>- A player keeps track of the number of hits his combat rolls produce. The total number of hits he produces will destroy units during the "Assign Hits" step.23</p>

<p>-If a player has an ability that rerolls a die or affects a die after it is rolled, he must resolve that ability immediately after rolling the die. For example, if the player made a combat roll for his dreadnoughts, he must decide if he wants to use an ability to reroll those dice before making a combat roll for his destroyers.</p>
<p>- The attacker makes all of his combat rolls during this step before the defender. This procedure is important for abilities that allow a player to reroll an opponent's die.</p>
<p>67.6 STEP 4-ASSIGN HITS: Each player must choose and destroy one of his ships in the active system for each hit his opponent produced.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Before assigning hits, players may use their units' "Sustain Damage" abilities to cancel hits.</li>
    <li>When a unit is destroyed, the player who controls that unit removes it from the board and places it in his reinforcements.</li>
</ul>
<p>67.7 STEP 5-RETREAT: If a player announced a retreat during the first step of a combat, he must retreat.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a player announced a retreat during the "Announce Retreats" step and if his opponent has no ships left in the system, the combat immediately ends and the retreat does not occur.</li>
    <li>To retreat, a player takes all of his ships in the combat that have a move value and moves them to an adjacent system. Fighters and ground forces in the active system that are unable to move or be transported are destroyed</li>
    <li>The system that a player's units retreat to must contain one or more of his units, a planet he controls, or both. Additionally, the system cannot contain ships controlled by another player.</li>
    <li>After retreating, a player must place a command token from his reinforcements in the system to which he retreated. If that system already contains one of his command tokens, he does not place an additional token there. If the player has no command tokens in his reinforcements, he must use one from his command sheet instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>67.8 After the "Retreat" step, if both players still have ships in the active system, they resolve another round of space combat beginning with the "Announce Retreats" step.</p>
<p>67.9 Space combat ends immediately when only one player-or neither player-has a ship in the active system.</p>
<ul><li>"End of combat" and "end of combat round" effects still occur.</li></ul>
<p>67.10 After a combat ends, the player with one or more ships remaining in the system is the winner of the combat; the other player is the loser of the combat. If neither player has a ship remaining, the combat ends in a draw and there is no winner.</p>
<ul><li>If the winner of the combat has fighters or ground forces in space that exceed his ships' capacity in the active system, he must destroy the excess units of his choice.</li></ul>

<div class="clTopicText">
<p>During the status phase, players score objectives and prepare for the next game round. To resolve the status phase, players perform the following steps:</p>
<p>70.1 STEP 1-SCORE OBJECTIVES: Following initiative order, each player may score up to one public objective and one secret objective that can be fulfilled during the status phase. To score an objective, he must fulfill the requirements on the card; if he does, he gains a number of victory points indicated on the card.</p>
<p>70.2 STEP 2-REVEAL PUBLIC OBJECTIVE: The speaker reveals an unrevealed public objective card by flipping that card faceup.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The speaker cannot reveal "Stage II" objectives until all "Stage I" objectives are revealed.</li>
    <li>The game ends if there are no unrevealed public objectives at the start of this step.</li>
</ul>
<p>70.3 STEP 3-DRAW ACTION CARDS: Following initiative order, each player draws one action card.</p>
<p>70.4 STEP 4-REMOVE COMMAND TOKENS: Each player removes all of his command tokens from the game board and returns them to his reinforcements.</p>
<p>70.5 STEP 5-GAIN AND REDISTRIBUTE COMMAND TOKENS: Each player gains two command tokens from his reinforcements. Then, he can redistribute all of the command tokens on his command sheet, including the two he just gained, among his strategy, tactic, and fleet pools.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Players should remember to check the number of their ships in each system after reducing the size of their fleet pools.</li>
    <li>This step can usually be resolved simultaneously, but if there is a timing conflict, it is resolved in initiative order.</li>
</ul>
<p>70.6 STEP 6-READY CARDS: Each player readies all of his exhausted cards, including strategy cards.</p>
<p>70.7 STEP 7-REPAIR UNITS: Each player repairs all of his units that have the "Sustain Damage" ability by turning those units upright.</p>
<p>70.8 STEP 8-RETURN STRATEGY CARDS: Each player returns his strategy card to the common play area. Then, if a player has removed the custodians token from Mecatol Rex, the game round continues to the agenda phase. Otherwise, a new game round begins with the strategy phase.</p>

<p>78.1 STEP 1-ACTIVATION: The active player must activate a system that does not contain one of his command tokens.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To activate a system, the active player places a command token from his tactic pool on that system. That system is the active system.</li>

<p>Technology cards allow players to upgrade units and acquire powerful abilities.</p>
<p>79.1 Each player places any technologies he has gained faceup near his faction sheet. He owns those cards for the duration of the game and can use their abilities.</p>
<p>79.2 A player does not own the technology cards in histechnology deck.</p>
<p>79.3 A player can gain technology cards from his technology deck by researching technology.</p>
<ul><li>Both the primary and secondary abilities of the "Technology" strategy card allow a player to research a technology.</li></ul>
<p>79.4 Any technology cards that a player has not gained remain in his technology deck. A player can look through his technology deck at any time.</p>
<p>79.5 If an ability instructs a player to gain a technology, he does not research it; he takes it from his technology deck and places it in his play area, ignoring prerequisites.</p>
<p>79.6 Some technologies are unit upgrades. Unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player's faction sheet.</p>
<ul><li>Players place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.</li></ul>
<p>79.7 Each technology that is not a unit upgrade has a colored symbol displayed in the lower-right corner of the card and on its card back that indicates that technology's color.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A technology's color has no inherent game effect; however, each technology a player owns can satisfy a prerequisite of a matching color when researching other technology.</li>
    <li>Unit upgrades do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.</li>
    <li>There are four colors of technologies as shown in the Rule Reference manual</li>
</ul>
<p>79.8 Most technology cards have a column of colored symbols displayed in the lower-left corner of the card. Each symbol in this column is a prerequisite.</p>
<ul><li>A technology card's prerequisites indicate the number and color of technologies a player must own to research that technology card.</li></ul>
<p>79.9 RESEARCHING TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>A player can research technology by resolving either the primary or secondary ability of the "Technology" strategy card during the action phase. Other game effects may also instruct a player to research technology.</p>
<p>79.10 To research technology, a player gains that technology card from his technology deck and places it in his play area near his faction sheet.</p>
<ul><li>Players place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.</li></ul>
<p>79.11 A player cannot research a faction technology that does not match his faction.</p>
<p>79.12 When researching technology, a player must satisfy each of a technology's prerequisites to research it. To satisfy a technology's prerequisites, he must own one technology of the matching color for each prerequisite symbol on the technology card he wishes to research.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prerequisites symbols are displayed as symbols on the lower-left corner of the card.</li>
    <li>Unit upgrade technologies do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.</li>
    <li>Players may use certain abilities or technology specialties to ignore some prerequisites.</li>
</ul>
<p>79.13 TECHNOLOGY SPECIALTIES</p>
<p>A technology specialty is a technology symbol found on some planets.</p>
<p>79.14 When researching technology, a player can exhaust a planet he controls that has a technology specialty to ignore one prerequisite symbol of the matching type on the technology card he is researching.</p>
<p>79.15 If the planet card is already exhausted, it cannot be used to ignore a prerequisite.</p>
<p>79.16 VALEFAR ASSIMILATOR</p>
<p>The Nekro Virus faction can use its faction abilities in combination with its two "Valefar Assimilator" faction technologies to gain faction technologies that have been researched by other players, including unit upgrades.</p>
<p>79.17 Basic units printed on faction sheets are not technologies and are not eligible targets for "Valefar Assimilator."</p>
<p>79.18 If a player is eliminated while one of his technologies has a Valefar Assimilator token on it, the Nekro Virus player places that technology in his play area; it is not removed from the game.</p>
<p>79.19 If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from the Saar "Floating Factory" unit upgrade, each of the Nekro Virus‚Äô space docks must be placed on an eligible planet he controls in that space dock‚Äôs system, or the space dock is returned to his reinforcements.</p>
<p>79.20 If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from a war sun unit upgrade and the Nekro Virus does not have the standard war sun unit upgrade, each of Nekro Virus‚Äô war suns are returned to his reinforcements.</p>
<p>79.21 The Nekro Virus may upgrade his units with units of the same type (e.g., "dreadnought" or "infantry") even if their names do not match. If the Nekro Virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same unit type as a unit upgrade technology he already has, the previous upgrade is removed, and he must use the same Valefar Assimilator token as was used to copy the previous upgrade.</p>
<p>79.22 When a Valefar Assimilator token is on a technology, that technology‚Äôs color and type count toward objectives</p>

<br/>
<p><b>Q: </b>How should a space combat be resolved if it is mathematically impossible for either side to win‚Äîfor example, certain configurations of ships using the "Non-Euclidean Shielding" and "Duranium Armor" technologies in concert?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>If neither side has the potential to win, the attacker must retreat.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Q: </b>Can fighters block ship movement?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Yes, fighters can block ship movement (this was added as a correction in the Living Rules Reference version 1.1).</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Q: </b>Does each unit participating in Bombardment or Space Cannon roll an additional die for the Plasma Scoring technology?</p>

<br/>
<p><b>Q: </b>Can the "Shields Holding" action card be used to cancel hits from abilities that occur before combat, such as Dimensional Splicer and Devotion?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>No. "Shields Holding" may only be used to cancel hits that are produced during combat.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Q: </b>Can two "Direct Hit" action cards be played by the same player on the same round of combat against different targets?</p>
